# Destiny REPL

(some parts are still a work in progress but a majority is now working)

This a tool to let you see some stats. This tool is not as robust as some websites to see your stats
this is mainly used as my first personal project and may grow from here.

To install and use this CLI tool use the following below
``` bash
go install github.com/exglegaming/d2-stats-repl@latest
```

# Usage:


- `player <bungie name>` - Example: Name#1234. You can change players with this command
- `pvp` - Lets you see your PvP stats
- `pve` - Lets you see PvE stats
- `trials` - See trials stats
- `help` - See a list of all commands while in the program
- `exit` - Exit the program
